itâ€™s an empty Python file. It is called when the package or one of its modules is imported.
This file tells the python interpreter that this directory is a package and that the presence of the __init.py__ file makes

```
Cookies and sessions are both essential components in web development for managing user data and maintaining state.
While cookies are stored on the client-side and are used for tasks such as user identification and preference storage,
sessions are stored on the server-side and are used for storing more sensitive user data.
